# MOO2 Game Tree Search
The goal of this project is to perform a game-tree search related to the 1990's 4x strategy game Master of Orion 2.

In more detail:
The economic aspects of MOO2 have been coded in Python. At the moment this has been done specifically for a democratic, 
creative race with +2 research, but the code could be extended to support other races. 

Let's say that this reduced version of the game is completed if
1. Every tech field has been researched
2. Every colony in the empire has been terraformed to gaia and has reached full population
3. For every colony in the empire, every building, except possibly pollution processor and atmospheric renewer, 
has been built.

The goal of this project is find or approximatly find a minimal number of moves that completes the game.
